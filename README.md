## transform_conversions
This ROS package acts as an extension to `tf_conversions` and `tf/transform_datatypes` that are inherently built with ROS. `transform_conversions` provides further wrappers and convenience functions to quickly convert between transform types including `tf::Transform`; `Eigen::Matrix4d` (and other `Eigen` types), as well as `geometry_msgs` message types. This package is a work in progress and likely has missing functionality. Python conversions for `numpy` are also supported. For your specific use cases, issues and pull requests are greatly appreciated.
